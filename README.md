# A MOP for Perl 5

This repository contains an ever evolving proposal for a
Meta Object Protocol, or MOP, to be perhaps included in a
future version of Perl 5.

The core goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and
highly Perl-ish MOP that will provide the same degree of
flexibility and TIMTOWTDI of the original Perl 5 object
model, but with more a formalized class model.

This proposal will be developed in the open and comments
are welcome.
