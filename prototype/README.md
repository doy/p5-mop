# A prototype of the MOP for Perl 5

**NOTE: This is still _VERY_ much a work in progress**

This is a _very rough_ prototype of the proposed MOP
for Perl 5. The main purpose of this prototype is
to work out the MOP API as well as some key functionality.
Ideally this might also provide the starts of a test
suite that can be ported to the final implementation.

**NOTE:** This prototype should in no way be taken as
an accurate portrayal of the code or syntax of the
final proposal, it is mearly a sandbox for testing
out the ideas and will most certainly contain some
ugly weird hacks to make things work correctly in
Pure Perl 5.
